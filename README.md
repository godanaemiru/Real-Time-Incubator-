# Real-Time-Incubator-

This is an embedded systems project on an infant baby incubator which measures temperatures of the incubator environment in real time and adjusts it accordingly. It also sends sms messages via gsm to a health worker if for any reason, the incubator environment temperatures spiral out of control.
